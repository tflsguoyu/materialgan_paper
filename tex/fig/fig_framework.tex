	\caption{Our inverse rendering pipeline. We optimize for latent vectors $\bw^+$ and $\noise$, that feed into the layers of the StyleGAN2-based MaterialGAN model. The MaterialGAN generator produces material maps (diffuse albedo, normal, roughness and specular albedo), that are rendered under the captured view/light settings. Finally, the renderings and measurements are compared using a combination of L2 and perceptual losses.}
