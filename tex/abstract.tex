    We address the problem of reconstructing spatially-varying BRDFs from a small set of image measurements.
    This is a fundamentally under-constrained problem, and previous work has relied on using various regularization priors or on capturing many images to produce plausible results.
    In this work, we present \emph{MaterialGAN}, a deep generative convolutional network based on StyleGAN2, trained to synthesize realistic SVBRDF parameter maps.
    We show that MaterialGAN can be used as a powerful material prior in an inverse rendering framework: we optimize in its latent representation to generate material maps that match the appearance of the captured images when rendered.
    We demonstrate this framework on the task of reconstructing SVBRDFs from images captured under flash illumination using a hand-held mobile phone. Our method succeeds in producing plausible material maps that accurately reproduce the target images, and outperforms previous state-of-the-art material capture methods in evaluations on both synthetic and real data.
    Furthermore, our GAN-based latent space allows for high-level semantic material editing operations such as generating material variations and material morphing.

    %SVBRDF capture from photographs remains a challenging and actively researched task. Classic methods used heavy equipment and/or many light and view direction samples, while recent work has significantly decreased these requirements through the use of neural techniques. In this paper, we make further progress in designing a general framework for SVBRDF capture. Our key improvement is optimization in the latent space of a generative adversarial network (specifically StyleGAN) trained to generate plausible SVBRDF maps. For multi-image capture with co-located camera and light source, we demonstrate results that succeed in the combined goals of matching the target images and producing plausible material maps. Furthermore, our GAN-based latent space offers the additional ability to edit the latent vector to achieve semantically meaningful operations such as morphing.
